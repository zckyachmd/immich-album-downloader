## üß† How it works (aka ‚Äúthe vibe check‚Äù)

- It talks to your Immich server using your API key
- It fetches albums and assets, filters them based on your flags
- For each asset, it checks:  
  1. Does the file already exist?  
  2. Does the checksum match?  
  3. Did we already mark this asset as downloaded in SQLite?

- If yes ‚Üí skip  
- If no ‚Üí download it, verify it, log it, move on

All files are downloaded to folders that match your Immich album names ‚Äî no weird nesting.
