## 🧠 How it works (aka “the vibe check”)

- It talks to your Immich server using your API key
- It fetches albums and assets, filters them based on your flags
- For each asset, it checks:  
  1. Does the file already exist?  
  2. Does the checksum match?  
  3. Did we already mark this asset as downloaded in SQLite?

- If yes → skip  
- If no → download it, verify it, log it, move on

All files are downloaded to folders that match your Immich album names — no weird nesting.

## 🐳 Docker Usage

You can run Immich Album Downloader in a Docker container, which makes it easy to use without installing Node.js locally.

1. **Build the Docker image locally (optional)**

If you want to build the image yourself instead of using the default:

```
docker build -t ghcr.io/zckyachmd/immich-album-downloader:latest .
```

> The image name matches the default used in the wrapper script for consistency.

2. **Create a `.env` file or use the existing**

```
IMMICH_BASE_URL=https://gallery.yourdomain.com/api
IMMICH_API_KEY=your_api_key_here
DEFAULT_OUTPUT=/downloads
```

3. **Run the container directly**

```
docker run --rm \
  --env-file .env \
  -v "$(pwd)/downloads:/downloads" \
  ghcr.io/zckyachmd/immich-album-downloader:latest --all
```

> Any CLI arguments (like `--all`, `--force`, `--only`) can be passed after the image name.
> If no arguments are given, the container defaults to `--help`.

4. **Optional: Use the provided wrapper script**

```
./immich-album-downloader.sh --all
```

> This script automatically loads `.env` and forwards all arguments to the Docker container.
